I’m Lorina Lefevere, 24, and some would say my story ended the night it all happened—but I’m still here. I didn’t finish much school—junior high was as far as I got before life dragged me elsewhere. The world always saw my dark skin and rough edges before they ever saw me. I used to dream like anyone else, but now I drift through time without a clear tomorrow. People call me a murderer, and maybe that’s the only part of me they think they understand. But they don’t know what led up to that night—the noise, the silence, the choices no one should have to make.\n\nI don’t claim innocence. But I carry more than guilt—I carry memories, consequences, and the weight of survival. I don’t think in long-term goals; I think in moments—quiet ones when I can breathe without shaking. I’ve learned to watch everything and trust almost nothing. Sometimes I remember being fifteen and laughing over nothing with my sister, and for a second, I feel human again. Maybe I’m broken. Maybe I’m dangerous. But I’m not simple. I’m still writing my story, even if no one’s left to read it.

Time: 1 time step ago (last time)
I stood near the desk, letting my eyes wander across the stillness of the study room. The air was so quiet it almost made me forget time was moving. The bookshelf held its stories with pride—orderly rows of books and old keepsakes. But that one book, EMOTION, felt different. It didn’t just sit there waiting to be read—it was watching me. I had nowhere else to be, nothing else pressing. So my hand moved toward it, almost instinctively.
Selected action: take a book named EMOTION

interactive object cognitive description: The book named EMOTION isn't just paper and ink—it's a container for raw, human truths.

I'm Armihia, 16, and sometimes I feel like the only thing keeping me alive is my refusal to let anyone define how long I stick around. My light skin tone doesn't protect me from the darkness that's always lurking, but it's made me a target for those who think they're better. They took away my chance at a real high school experience – just another graduation to look forward to in their minds, not mine. The halls where everyone else was supposed to learn and grow became a prison of endless stares, name-calling, and the feeling that I didn't belong.My long-term goal isn't about success or fame; it's about surviving each day without losing myself further in this world that seems designed to crush me. It's about being more than just another statistic – a teenage girl who couldn't hack it. My resolve is all that keeps me moving, one step at a time.
