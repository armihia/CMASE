I'm Armihia, 16, and sometimes I feel like the only thing keeping me alive is my refusal to let anyone define how long I stick around. My light skin tone doesn't protect me from the darkness that's always lurking, but it's made me a target for those who think they're better. They took away my chance at a real high school experience – just another graduation to look forward to in their minds, not mine. The halls where everyone else was supposed to learn and grow became a prison of endless stares, name-calling, and the feeling that I didn't belong.My long-term goal isn't about success or fame; it's about surviving each day without losing myself further in this world that seems designed to crush me. It's about being more than just another statistic – a teenage girl who couldn't hack it. My resolve is all that keeps me moving, one step at a time.
